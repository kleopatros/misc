/// <summary>
/// Challenge: Get the maximal sum of non-adjacent values in an array.
/// 
/// Tags: dynamic programming, arrays.
/// 
/// Description:
/// 
/// There are n houses built in a line, each of which contains some value in it. A thief is
/// going to steal the maximal value in these houses, but he cannot steal in two adjacent houses
/// because the owner of a stolen house will tell his two neighbors on the left and right side.
/// What is the maximal stolen value?
/// 
/// For example, if there are four houses with values {6, 1, 2, 7}, the maximal stolen value is
/// 13 when the first and fourth houses are stolen.
/// 
/// Analysis:
/// 
/// A function f(i) is defined to denote the maximal stolen value from the first house to the
/// ith house, and the value contained in the ith house is denoted as vi.When the thief reaches
/// the ith house, he has two choices: to steal or not.Therefore, f(i) can be defined with the
/// following equation:
/// 
///     f(i) = max[vi + f(i - 2) when the ith house is stolen, f(i - 1) otherwise]
///     
/// It would be much more efficient to calculate in bottom-up order than to calculate
/// recursively. It looks like a 1D array with size n is needed, but actually it is only
/// necessary to cache two values for f(i-1) and f(i-2) to calculate f(i).
